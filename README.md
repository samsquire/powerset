# powerset
calculate powerset using recursive functions in python

I translated the function definition from set syntax from Wikipedia and [Byjus website](https://byjus.com/maths/power-set/) into code so the code is not exactly intuitive or pretty.

On my [code generation](https://github.com/samsquire/code-generation) project I am talking of a programming lanaguage that allows the specification of algebraic relationships between functions. Maybe this problem would be useful there.
